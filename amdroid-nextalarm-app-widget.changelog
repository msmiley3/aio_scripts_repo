1.10:

- Removed prefs._name from script
- Text now correctly displayed with primary text color ( was fixed white in previous version, so it wouldnt be visible in some themes)
- settings dialog added (just because I do not like the default one that pops up when you click on the cog of script widgets.)
- telegram link of author added in meta so people can report bugs
